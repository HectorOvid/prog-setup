# AGILE THOUGHTS

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Is scrum agile?

### Daily
for projects can be good, if really focused?

for teams, mb. weird bc. so much stuff is not really relevant for you, and the
15 min per days 5 days per week sums up quickly

however everyone knows a bit more what the other people are doing, which has some value

### Meetings
Refinement with its estimations helps planning, of course but what if we just do not do planning.

Should be the target: Focus on the work to be done.
How much does estimating help that?


### Comparison


#### Processes

Agility: “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”
Scrum: “processes and many tools to monitor and increase development speed.”

Processes and tools should help you doing your job and supplement it.


#### Software State

Agility: “Working software over comprehensive documentation”
Scrum: “Document source code, document architecture, document test strategy, document execution of each test
, document the reason for everything you are doing, and how and why are they doing it.
Also please use the templates and rules about how all this documentation should be written,
because they’ll work better if we have them writing in prose instead of bullet points.”


#### Customer interaction

Agility: “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation”
Scrum: ”Create a representative (PO) so that not a single developer ever needs to talk to a client.”


#### Change ~ Agility :)

Agility: “Responding to change over following a plan”
Scrum: “Have an artificial 2 weeks sprint interval that will delay our ability to respond to changes,
but will supposedly help us create metrics to plan the rest of the project”

Note: "we never really work this way bc. of how annyoing it is if you want sth from sb else and he says, ok i plan it in the next sprint
expect result in 3-4 weeks"


### Quibs & quotes

- if your team talks to each other, you can actually throw away 90% of scrum things
- "I like Agile. It's a set of principles. The closer your team and stakeholders hold to the principles, the better your experience as a dev. If your SCRUM master acts as an intermediary and stands up for your team, while holding you accountable for your work, then they are valuable. If your Product Owner actually writes meaningful ACs, then that's even better. It's a lot of "ifs," but I've tasted the sweet glory of good practices as a dev."

### Alternatives

- List of big points (epics) what we want and need to to next
- Describe what the change of this epic is in a proposal: Problem, Solutions, Decision that shows a bit what and why we did it.
- weekly discuss who is working on what 
- consider creating small sub-tasks for each of the epics if the person working on it wants and needs that
